# About this Repository
- train.py:  trains the target model from scratch and saves it to a file
- test.py: tests the generated model
- .py: tests the generated model

# About the Model and Structure

# The Model Result
- i.e. several measures of accuracy and performance

# How to Setup the Running Environment

python3 -m venv venv_see
# activate the virtual environment
source venv_see/bin/activate
# install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to Run

```
# activate the virtual environment
source venv_see/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```
OR
```
venv_see/bin/python3 main.py
```
